You can tag a time and location as a "point of interest" using the POI API.  This API is only available when the `kismetdb` log is enabled.

## Create a POI
A POI is entered in the `kismetdb` log file as a `snapshot` record of type `POI`.  A POI will have the current GPS location and time, and an optional note.
